      </h2>
      <p className="text-slate-400 mb-4">
        After graduating from Laval University in 2018 with a degree in
        Bioinformatics, I found myself at a crossroads. Although I gained
        valuable skills in Python, SQL, and big data manipulation, I realized my
        true passion lay in building websites and crafting intuitive user
        interfaces. Determined to follow this passion, I decided to{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-bold">teach myself</span> web
        development.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-400 mb-4">
        Over the past <span className="text-white font-bold">6 years</span>, I
        have dedicated myself to coding daily, mastering various frameworks and
        technologies, and honing best practices in version control. My journey
        has included working for a small web design agency and freelancing on
        the side, during which I have successfully helped{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-bold">60+ clients</span> bring their
        ideas to life. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-400 mb-4">
        My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive, and
        high-performance websites through freelancing on <span>Upwork</span> and{" "}
        <span>Fiverr</span>. Althought I love freelancing, it was always meant
        to be a stepping stone throught which I will be able to pratice and
        master my newly learned skills. I am ready to take my talents to a
        company and seeking new opportunities to collaborate with a talented
        team of developers and designers, where I can continue to learn, grow
        and contribute to creating exceptional web experiences. <br />
